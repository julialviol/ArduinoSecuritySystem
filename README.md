# ArduinoSecuritySystem

# Description
This project is acts as a security system with a password using the keypad. The LCD prompts the user to 'Enter a Password'. The RGB LED changes from red to green depending on if the password was entered correctly or not. Keys such as ‘A’ ‘B’ ‘C’ ‘D’ will display 'Invalid key' on the LCD. A servo motor is included to imitate a door opening when the correct password is inputed.

# Materials Required
Arduino UNO R3 Controller Board

Arduino UNO R3 USB Power Cord

Arduino IDE Software

Female and Male Jumper Wires

1kΩ Resistors

LCD display module (16 x 2)

Keypad module

RGB LED module

Servo module

# Description of Sensors and Modules used
__LCD display__: This is a 16-character 2-line glass display with a serial interface

__Keypad Module__: This is a 16-button keypad that provides tactile input into a program/computer

__RGB LED__: This module outputs red, blue and green in a colour fade/mix effect

__Servo Module__: A Servo module rotates its shaft to a set position, between 0 and 120 degrees

# Built With
Built using a physical Ardiuno UNO kit, then recreated on TinkerCAD using an Arduino Uno R3 for demonstration purposes
